## ✨ Overview ✨

Here’s a quick look at the projects I worked on:

1. **Number Guessing Game**: A fun and simple game made using Visual Studio Code.
2. **Currency Converter Application**: A tool to convert currencies, developed with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 🎲 Project 1: Number Guessing Game

### 🔍 Introduction

The **Number Guessing Game** is a console game where you guess a number between 1 and 100. It’s a simple yet engaging game that helps practice basic Java skills. This project was created using Visual Studio Code.

### 🏆 Features

- **🎯 Random Number Generation**: The game picks a number randomly for you to guess.
- **🛠️ User Input Validation**: Checks if your guesses are valid and provides helpful feedback.
- **🔄 Replay Option**: You can play again after finishing the game, making each session a new challenge.

### ⚙️ How to Run

To run this game, follow these steps in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code** and make sure the Java extension is installed.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ck-sayan/number-guessing-game.git
   ```

3. **Open the Project Folder** in Visual Studio Code.

4. **Run the Program**:
   - Open `NumberGuessingGame.java`.
   - Press `F5` to run or select the Run option from the menu.

   Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and the necessary extensions set up in VS Code.

## 💰 Project 2: Currency Converter Application

### 🔍 Introduction

The **Currency Converter Application** helps you convert amounts between different currencies. It uses live data from the CurrencyLayer API and was developed with IntelliJ IDEA.

### 🏆 Features

- **🌍 Wide Currency List**: Convert between many different currencies.
- **💡 Easy to Use**: Simple prompts for entering the source currency, target currency, and amount.
- **🔗 Real-Time Data**: Retrieves current exchange rates using the CurrencyLayer API.
- **📊 Clear Results**: Shows the conversion result or an error message if something goes wrong.

### 🌐 API Integration

The application uses the **CurrencyLayer API** to fetch live exchange rates for accurate currency conversions.

### ⚙️ How to Run

To use this application, follow these steps in IntelliJ IDEA:

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA** and get ready to explore the code.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ck-sayan/currency-converter.git
   ```

3. **Open the Project** in IntelliJ IDEA.

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Open `CurrencyConverter.java`.
   - Use the Run configuration to compile and run the program.

   Make sure all project dependencies are correctly set up, either using `pom.xml` for Maven or manual setup.

## 🎉 Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to review my projects! These applications reflect the skills and knowledge I’ve gained during my internship at CODXO. The **Number Guessing Game** demonstrates foundational Java programming techniques and user interaction, while the **Currency Converter Application** showcases more advanced concepts such as API integration and real-time data processing.

Each project was developed using a different Integrated Development Environment (IDE), illustrating my adaptability and proficiency with various tools. I hope you find the code and the functionality of these projects insightful.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, need further clarification, or just want to discuss the projects. Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

Best regards,
